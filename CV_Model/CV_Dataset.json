mml ini parser tool mml is configuration tool used in communication equipments this configuration tool has set of default and user defined commands. ini parsing tool is a tool which accepts mml commands in certain grammar and generates resource file and binary file respectively which will be read by server to resister the commands. involved in the development, testing, verification of the module on windows. module - man machine language mml is a configuration tool widely used in communication equipments. it uses client/server architecture. mml server communicates with both the client and the app in the equipment. it receives mml commands inputted by users from the client and relays it to app to process it. after acquiring the processing result, the server generates a mml report and sends it back to the client. it interacts with other system modules. connection management, authorization management, command process, data synchronization, event notification, command parsing, log/alarm handling are some of the functions of mml server. involved in the development, defect fixing and verification of the module on windows, linux and vxworks platforms involved in several release activities. module - configuration management configuration management module is core module of system management. its main function is to define specifications for configuration management interface between the configuration tool layer and the application layer, and provide related configuration command communication mechanism. any information that can be modified by the user/application and that affects the functionality of the application can be regarded as configurable data. all configuration commands can be sent to configuration management module using a common interface type. configuration data management module is a supplementary optional component that can be loaded to provide a persistent storage (&amp; retrieval) mechanism for applications' static configuration data. involved in the defect fixing and feature enhancement of the module on windows, linux and vxworks platforms involved in several release activities. module - tl1 transaction language 1 (tl1) is a widely used, \"legacy\", management protocol in telecommunications. it is a cross-vendor, cross-technology man-machine language, and is widely used to manage synchronous optical networks (sonet) . it is defined for operation system/ network element (machine-to-machine) interfaces. tl1 corresponds to the user system language (usl), which is the language for human-to machine interactions. it is used for managing network elements in a network. tl1 module is an interface between an application and client. client sends the tl1 commands to perform some configuration operations in the applications. tl1 module process the client text tl1 commands according to standard specification tl1 gr 831 and interacts with the configuration management module and convert response messages back to tl1 response messages involved in development, verification and customer and release activities. i was a module lead for this project. module - qx the qx interface is a company proprietary application layer protocol between target and the gui of nms. by this protocol, ne can communicate with scc (system communication and control) software in different operation system. each command has defined format. commands are given in binary form. qx module acts as an interface between the client and application. involved in development, verification and customer and release activities. i was a module lead for this project. role: designer/developer/ reviewer/ responsibility: designing and coding various modules involvement in peer review and overall review activities and project discussions coordinating the development cycle training team members and solving project related issues configuration management of the project using clear case duration: from june 2004 to sep 2006 hardware: x86, cpci, atca software: c++, c project2: wireless lan -
